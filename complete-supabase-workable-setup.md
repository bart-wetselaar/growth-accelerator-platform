# Complete Supabase + Workable + Azure Domains Setup

## ✅ Current Status
- Supabase project configured: https://doulsumepjfihqowzheq.supabase.co
- Workable API connected: 50 candidates available
- Azure Static Web Apps deployed
- GitHub workflows configured

## 🎯 Required Manual Steps (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Deploy Database Schema in Supabase
1. Go to your **Supabase SQL Editor**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/doulsumepjfihqowzheq/sql
2. Copy the entire content from `supabase-schema.sql` (already created)
3. Paste it into the SQL Editor and click **Run**
4. This creates all tables, indexes, and enables real-time features

### Step 2: Add Workable API Key
1. Go to **Supabase Settings > Environment Variables**
2. Add new variable:
   - Name: `WORKABLE_API_KEY` 
   - Value: (Your existing Workable API key - already in system)

### Step 3: Configure Azure Custom Domains
Your existing domains can now point to the new Supabase-powered app:

**DNS Configuration:**
- `web` → CNAME to `white-coast-08429c303.1.azurestaticapps.net`

## 🚀 Automated Workable Data Sync

Once the schema is deployed, you can sync your 50 candidates automatically:

```bash
# Run this command to sync all Workable data
python3 sync-workable-direct.py
```

## 🌐 Your Live Deployment URLs

**Immediate Access:**
- Primary: https://white-coast-08429c303.1.azurestaticapps.net
