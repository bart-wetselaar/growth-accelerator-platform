- Self-solving error system actively monitoring and fixing deployment issues
- Complete integration package delivered for external system embedding
- Real-time monitoring dashboard accessible at `/self-solving`
- Automated error detection and resolution running every 30 seconds

## Architecture
- **Backend**: Flask application with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon-backed) via Replit built-in database
- **API Integration**: Real Workable API connection with live data
- **Self-Solving System**: Automated error detection and fix deployment
- **Integration Package**: Python SDK, JavaScript widget, webhook handler
- **Monitoring**: 24/7 system health checks and automated recovery

## Key Features
- Real Workable API integration with live job and candidate data
- AI-powered candidate matching and suggestions
- Self-solving error system with automated fix deployment
- Real-time monitoring dashboard with system health metrics
- Complete integration package for external system embedding
- Background monitoring with intelligent rate limiting
- Automated GitHub uploads and Azure deployment triggers

## User Preferences
- Prefers comprehensive solutions with real data integration
- Values automated error resolution and system reliability
- Requires production-ready code for external integrations
- Focuses on practical functionality over mock demonstrations

## Technical Decisions
- Using Replit's built-in PostgreSQL database for reliability
- Flask chosen for web framework due to simplicity and integration ease
- Self-solving system implemented with background monitoring threads
- Integration package designed for multiple framework compatibility (Flask, Django)
- Workable API integration provides authentic recruitment data
